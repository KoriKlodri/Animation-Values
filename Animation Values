 (X, Z, Y)  X moves left and right
(-X,-Y,-Z)  Y moves up and down
	    Z moves forward and back
WHY THE HELL ARE Y AND Z NOT IN ORDER. I DONT FUCKING GET IT AND IT ONLY MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT ALREADY IS.
Im moving objects in a 3D environment and the C-Frame values arent even ordered? W H Y ? It bothers me to an unfathomable extent and I am trying to find a way
to clean it up.

If you add or subtract from one a value, you have to add or subtract the opposite from the corrisponding value.

So (-1.03,-0.75,-0.73)
   (0.53,0.12,1.55)

with the x value (-1.03)  turned into 0 would look like this

	(0,  -0.75, -0.73)
        (-.5, 0.12, 1.55)

So X is always +.5 of -X
and Z is always +2.3 of -Z
Do not ask me why these specific values are correct in terms of coordionate placement, because I have not a single clue, this whole thing is built off of fucking popsicle sticks
and chinese sweatshop dreams.

Y seems to be the only exception for some reason. Y and -Y are directly connected where -Y goes up and down with -Y. Why isnt this inversely proportional like the others?
I have no fucking clue. Y is apperently Different enough that its coordinate system FUNCTIONS COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY. At least this is easier to do efficiency wise since you can just
the number into a calculator, unlike the others where I need to do a rain dance in order to get them to work.

So (-1.03,-0.85,-0.73)
   (0.53,0.12,1.55)

with the Y value (-.85) turned into 0 would look like this

	(0,  0, -0.73)
        (-.5, 0.97, 1.55)

The change in Y and -Y is .85
Again, no fucking clue why this value is correct. It literally keeps me up at night that these specific values are correct for no apperent reason..
